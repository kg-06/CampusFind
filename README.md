# üéí CampusFind

> A MERN-stack web app to connect students who lose or find items within the university.  
> Unlike traditional boards that dump every request publicly, our system uses a **smart matching engine** to privately connect only relevant users.

## üöÄ Problem We Solve
Losing something on campus (ID card, earbuds, wallet‚Ä¶) is common, but:
- Most solutions just show a noisy public feed.
- Users must manually search through endless posts.
- Privacy is not respected.

---

## üí° Our Twist (Differentiator)
- Requests are **not public** by default.
- Each Lost/Found request runs through a **matching algorithm** (tags, description, category, location).
- If similarity ‚â• 60% ‚Üí a **match is created**.
- Both users get an **email notification** + can **chat inside the app**.
- If no match yet, system waits ‚Üí notifies when a future request matches.

This makes the platform **smarter, private, and effective**.
